## Introduction <br>
    - Titanic (Royal Mail Ship Titanic), was a British luxury passenger liner that sank on the 15th of April, 1912, during its voyage to New York City from Southampton, England. This led to the death of about 1,500 passengers and this day is seen as one of the most tragic incidents in history. 

    - In this project, we gathered insight about this catastrophe through the exploration of the [Titanic extended dataset (Kaggle + Wikipedia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavlofesenko/titanic-extended) on Kaggle.

        We were able to find answers to questions regarding 

1. How did affluence affect survivability?
2. Which age group was more likely to survive?
3. Did the bond of larger families improve survivability?
4. Which states in the United States were passengers heading to and what were the deaths per state?
5. Where did passengers originate, and what were the deaths per country of origin?
6. What were the most important variables in predicting a passenger's survival?

## Import environment <br>

In order to run the code you will need to import the Team4env.yml file to load the environment. To do this;

	- Make sure Anaconda is up to date
	- Open Anaconda Navigator
	- Go to Environment
	- Go to Import
	- Browse and locate the Team4env.yml file
	- Import
	- Use this environment to open the Python_Assignment_team4.ipynb file

## Libraries <br>

	1. pandas - Pandas was used for for data cleaning and analysis. 

	2. geopy - Geopy was used to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using third-party geocoders and other data sources

	3. numpy - NumPy was used for generating arrays and setting seeds for randomised tasks.

	4. folium - Folium was used to visualize data that's been manipulated on an interactive leaflet map.

	5. sklearn - The sklearn library was used for machine learning and statistical modelling including classification, regression and model evaluation and data partitioning.

	6. seaborn - Seaborn was used to draw attractive and informative statistical graphics.

	7. miceforest -  Mice forest was used to impute missing data using random forests in an iterative method known as Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE).

	8. matplotlib - Matplotlib was used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
